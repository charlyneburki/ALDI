# How are people doing ?

Quality of life has become a increasingly valuable factor in determining policies, governing strategic development and rethinking the way humans evaluate life. A lot of research has gone into improving humans life standard. Recently, indicators such as the Human Development Index (HDI) or customized indices like the OECD Better Life Index have emerged to account for other facets of life instead of simple GDP per capita. The advantages of employing a custom-made index is that a myriad of factors are accounted for, such that we are able to obtain a more accurate reading of "life". 

Indexes are usually employed to compare countries to one another, allowing organisation such as OECD to rank countries based on set criteria. Read on to learn how we applied that concept to the Greater London Area ! 

## Introducing ... ALDI !

Here, we propose a new and improved index to rank, not countries, but local regions in the Greater London Area, in England. More particularly, we look at [Wards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wards_and_electoral_divisions_of_the_United_Kingdom) and Boroughs which are structural localities specific to England. 

Our ALDI is special because ... it includes the following measures:

```markdown
1. Housing
2. Income
3. Jobs
4. Community
5. Education
6. Environment
7. Civic Engagement
8. Health
9. Life Satisfaction
10. Safety
11. Work-Life Balance
12. Foods 
```



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/charlyneburki/ALDI/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
